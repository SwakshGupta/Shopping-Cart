          Open Box Items: Terms & Conditions
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Welcome! Open box items offer great value, often being in new or
          like-new condition with the full manufacturer's warranty, despite the
          packaging possibly being damaged. Hereâ€™s what you should know:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Condition Assurance: Open box items are generally in new condition.
          Packaging damage is possible but doesn't affect the item's
          functionality or warranty.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Warranty Coverage: Items come with a full manufacturer's warranty.
          Keep your bill as it's necessary for any warranty claims.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          [Packaging Disclaimer: Discounted prices reflect the potential for
          damaged packaging, which does not compromise the product's quality.]
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Returns and Refunds: Returns based on operational defects or
          discrepancies from the described condition are accepted. An uncut
          unboxing video is required for all claims.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Order Cancellation Policy: Open Box items are inspected and quality
          checked before shipping. If defects not related to packaging are
          found, I may cancel the order and refund you, ensuring you receive
          only quality products.
        </p>
        <p>
          By buying an open-box item, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
          My goal is to ensure you get great products at a discount, even if the
          packaging shows a bit of wear.
